# Exam-Scheduling-Using-Graph-Algorithms
Develop an efficient exam scheduling system using graph algorithms to minimize scheduling conflicts and optimize resource utilization.

1.Backtracking Scheduling: Systematic exploration of all possible assignments to ensure optimal scheduling.
2.Greedy Scheduling: Assigns exams to time slots based on a heuristic, prioritizing exams with the highest constraints first.
3.Smallest Degree Last Scheduling: A vertex-coloring approach that schedules exams with fewer conflicts first, enhancing efficiency.
4.DSATUR Scheduling: Degree of Saturation heuristic that dynamically selects exams with the most constrained scheduling options.
5.Tabu Search Scheduling: Metaheuristic optimization technique that iteratively refines solutions, leveraging a tabu list to avoid cycling.
